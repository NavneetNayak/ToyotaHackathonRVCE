# ToyotaHackathon-RVCE-2019
I participated in the 36 hour "Toyota Hackathon 2019 Bangalore Edition: Code for Safer India" organised by Toyota &amp; India Road Safety Campaign held on 25-26 November 2019 at RV College of Engineering, Bangalore. Unfortunately I had no Idea about Github back then and didn't save the project :(

I'm the guy on the left in the attached video, It's been 3 years since, so I look like a baby in the video ðŸ˜‚. We actually planned to use Google's Flutter to program our app during the hackathon and everything seemed to be working fine a few days before. But on the day of the hackathon we couldn't get Flutter to work no matter what we did, so we were forced to learn Java from scratch and build our app using it. Most of our 36 hours of time was spent trying to figure out how Java worked. We somehow managed to produce a working app at the end of the 36 hours despite all the difficulties.
