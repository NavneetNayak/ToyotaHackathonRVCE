# ToyotaHackathon-RVCE-2019
I participated in the 36 hour "Toyota Hackathon 2019 Bangalore Edition: Code for Safer India" organised by Toyota &amp; India Road Safety Campaign held on 25-26 November 2019 at RV College of Engineering, Bangalore. Unfortunately I had no Idea about Github back then and didn't save the app :(
